serialmorse.py
==============

This is a simple Python script that can be used for CW (Morse code) practice. You can connect a straight key to a USB port over a serial-to-USB adapter, and the script generates audio that you can route to your favourite CW decoder program using JACK. You can verify your sending with the decoder.

The script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and Xubuntu 13.10 Linux. There's no real reason why it couldn't run on Windows, if you can successfully compile the "pyo" library on it.

Full installation instructions, with commands to install the necessary dependencies, are in the INSTALL file.

Please report all bugs through GitHub issue tracker.
