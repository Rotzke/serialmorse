serialmorse.py
==============

This is a simple Python script that can be used for CW (Morse code) practice. You can connect a straight key to a USB port over a serial-to-USB adapter, and the script generates audio that you can route to your favourite CW decoder program using JACK. You can verify your sending with the decoder.

The script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.8. It could also work on Linux (installation instructions for a recent Ubuntu are included; however, I haven't had time to figure out audio issues on Xubuntu 13.10).

Full installation instructions, with commands to install the necessary dependencies, are in the INSTALL file.

Please report all bugs through GitHub issue tracker, or submit a pull request. Also drop me a note if you figure out how to use it on Linux or Windows.
